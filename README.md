Advanced PHP Calculator
🔊 Voice Calculator
An interactive voice-enabled calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using speech recognition. This project enhances accessibility and simplifies calculations through a clean UI and real-time voice input processing.

🚀 Features
🎙️ Voice Recognition for Arithmetic Commands

🧮 Basic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
📊 Dynamic Graph Plotting for Mathematical Functions
🖥️ Real-time UI Updates
🎨 User-friendly Interface with Responsive Design
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – Page structure
CSS – Styling and layout
JavaScript – Speech recognition and logic implementation
PHP – Backend placeholder (optional; use for future data handling)


📂 Project Structure
voice-calculator/ ├── index.html ├── style.css ├── script.js ├── graph.js (optional) ├── functions.php (optional)

🧠 How It Works
User clicks the microphone icon.
JavaScript captures voice input using SpeechRecognition API.
Converts speech to text and parses the arithmetic expression.
Displays the result instantly.
If a mathematical function is mentioned (like plot sin x), it renders a graph using a canvas/charting library.
🖱️ How to Use
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/githubsagarkumar/Voice-calculator.git
cd Voice-calculator
Open index.html in a browser (preferably Chrome for best Speech API support).

Click on the 🎤 mic icon and speak a command:

Examples:

"What is 12 plus 7?"

"Calculate 50 divided by 5"

"Plot sine x"

View the result instantly on the screen.

📌 Future Improvements Add support for advanced math operations (square roots, exponents, etc.)

Integrate language localization

Store history using localStorage or backend DB

Dark mode toggle and accessibility themes
